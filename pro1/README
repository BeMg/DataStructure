INTRODUCTION

This is a story about two rats in the maze which has two floor.

FILE

    main.c

	Just like its name.
    
    mazes.txt

	It is data of maze.

	    In the maze,

		"X" = wall
		"." = the way rat can go
		"o" = the stair between two floors

    result.txt

	It is answer generate from program.

HOW DOES THIS PROGRAM WORK

    First, program will read the mazes.txt from file itself. It will have two floors maze. In the begin, the rat A is in (0,1,1) and the rat B is in (1,99,99).Second, let they go until three situation "A in (1,99,99)" "B in (0,1,1)" "A and B in same position". The program must stop, because maze must have way. Don't worry. 

HOW I CREATE AND USE STACK

    I use array to simulate stack. It is easy and it works. Just use array to store position of rat and declare a flag to drive the array in order to simulate top.

BUG FIXED

    I had three fatal bug happen. They are all hard to debug and waste my time. 
    The first bug is logic error. I set the stair to wall, so my rat would never go to stair. 
    The second bug is my definition at my first glance is not right. In my word, it is mean if rat in the stair just go down or up. It can't fly in the sky. 
    Third bug is output error, it is easy to debug.


Compile

    This program should use gcc -std=c99 to compile.

	gcc -std=c99 -o a.out main.c

    Or just use Makefile

	make

    The above two way will generate the same file named "a.out".

RUN

    Run a.out and enjoy.
